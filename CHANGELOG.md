# Changelog

## v0.2.0 — 2026-07-18

- Added a dedicated **Tests** stage (new stage 6, model Opus) between Dev and
  Lint/deploy: writes tests for new functionality, updates/repairs existing tests
  touched by the change, and adds edge-case + failure-path coverage.
- Hard **full-suite-green gate before deploy** — the deploy stage now requires both
  lint clean and the whole suite green; never advances on a red or partial run.
- Pipeline grew 8 → 9 stages; deploy/post-deploy/docs renumbered 7/8/9. Model
  tiering: Fable 1–4, Opus 5–6, inherit 7–9. Docs/tables/references synced.
- Added a real `/task-pipeline` slash command (`commands/task-pipeline.md`);
  `install.sh` now installs it to `~/.claude/commands/` alongside the skill so the
  command works for the plain-skill path too.
- Validator hardened: enforces marketplace↔plugin.json **version sync** and the
  presence of the command file.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-18

Initial release.

- Thin orchestrator skill that runs a task through 8 gated stages (docs study →
  brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent build → lint/deploy → post-deploy log check
  → docs/wiki sync), built on the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills.
- Hybrid distribution: Claude Code plugin/marketplace + plain `~/.claude/skills` copy.
- Soft per-stage model tiering (Fable stages 1–4, Opus stage 5, inherit 6–8) — reminder only.
- Generic-portable: stages 6–8 read the host project's `CLAUDE.md` conventions with detection fallbacks.
- Structural validator (`test/validate.py`); spec + plan under `docs/superpowers/`.
