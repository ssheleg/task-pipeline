# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-18

Initial release.

- Thin orchestrator skill that runs a task through 8 gated stages (docs study →
  brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent build → lint/deploy → post-deploy log check
  → docs/wiki sync), built on the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills.
- Hybrid distribution: Claude Code plugin/marketplace + plain `~/.claude/skills` copy.
- Soft per-stage model tiering (Fable stages 1–4, Opus stage 5, inherit 6–8) — reminder only.
- Generic-portable: stages 6–8 read the host project's `CLAUDE.md` conventions with detection fallbacks.
- Structural validator (`test/validate.py`); spec + plan under `docs/superpowers/`.
