# Changelog

## v0.4.0 — 2026-07-19

npm installer.

- **`bin/task-pipeline.js`** — zero-dependency Node installer CLI (mirrors
  `install.sh`: skill → `~/.claude/skills/task-pipeline`, command →
  `~/.claude/commands/`; idempotent, overwrite only behind `--force`).
- **`package.json`** — package name **`task-pipeline-skill`** (unscoped
  `task-pipeline` is taken on npm); bin command stays `task-pipeline`;
  `files` whitelist ships `bin` + `plugins`. Works without npm publish via
  `npx github:ssheleg/task-pipeline`; after publish also `npx task-pipeline-skill`.
- **Version sync is now four-way** (marketplace.json, plugin.json,
  package.json, CHANGELOG top entry) — validator enforces, plus checks the
  bin entry resolves and the files whitelist ships the skill sources.
- **CI:** `node --check` + a functional install run (fresh → rerun-skip →
  `--force`) against a fake `$HOME`.

## v0.3.0 — 2026-07-19

Packaging/tooling alignment with the ssheleg skill-repo canon (make-skill).

- **CI:** `.github/workflows/validate.yml` runs the structural validator on every
  push/PR, plus a **negative self-test** — corrupts a copy of the repo and expects
  the validator to FAIL (a validator that can't fail is decoration) — and a
  `bash -n` syntax check of `install.sh`.
- **Validator hardened:** now also enforces command frontmatter
  (`description` + `argument-hint`), **CHANGELOG top-entry version sync** with the
  manifests, and resolution of every relative markdown link in the repo.
- **`install.sh` is idempotent:** reruns skip already-installed skill/command;
  destructive overwrite only behind `--force` (never silently `rm -rf`s an
  existing install).
- **`/task-pipeline` is an idempotent entry point:** detects an existing pipeline
  TaskList and resumes from the first incomplete stage instead of restarting.
- **README:** added the `npx skills add ssheleg/task-pipeline` install path
  (vercel-labs skills CLI, 70+ agents) and a closing Russian section.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-07-18

- Added a dedicated **Tests** stage (new stage 6, model Opus) between Dev and
  Lint/deploy: writes tests for new functionality, updates/repairs existing tests
  touched by the change, and adds edge-case + failure-path coverage.
- Hard **full-suite-green gate before deploy** — the deploy stage now requires both
  lint clean and the whole suite green; never advances on a red or partial run.
- Pipeline grew 8 → 9 stages; deploy/post-deploy/docs renumbered 7/8/9. Model
  tiering: Fable 1–4, Opus 5–6, inherit 7–9. Docs/tables/references synced.
- Added a real `/task-pipeline` slash command (`commands/task-pipeline.md`);
  `install.sh` now installs it to `~/.claude/commands/` alongside the skill so the
  command works for the plain-skill path too.
- Validator hardened: enforces marketplace↔plugin.json **version sync** and the
  presence of the command file.

## v0.1.0 — 2026-07-18

Initial release.

- Thin orchestrator skill that runs a task through 8 gated stages (docs study →
  brainstorm → spec → plan → subagent build → lint/deploy → post-deploy log check
  → docs/wiki sync), built on the [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills.
- Hybrid distribution: Claude Code plugin/marketplace + plain `~/.claude/skills` copy.
- Soft per-stage model tiering (Fable stages 1–4, Opus stage 5, inherit 6–8) — reminder only.
- Generic-portable: stages 6–8 read the host project's `CLAUDE.md` conventions with detection fallbacks.
- Structural validator (`test/validate.py`); spec + plan under `docs/superpowers/`.
