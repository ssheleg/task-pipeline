"""What did this run leave on disk? — one ledger, and it prints even when the answer is nothing.

A run produces more than a diff. Three of this repository's Python suites built temp
trees and removed none of them — `test/plant_guard_test.py:34`, `test/doc_refs_test.py`
(three calls) and `test/pin_source_test.py` (two) — and, the part that matters, nothing
said so. Measured on 2026-08-20 under this machine's `$TMPDIR`:

    find "$TMPDIR" -maxdepth 4 -type f -path '*/copy/sub/b.sh' | wc -l   # 2536
    find "$TMPDIR" -maxdepth 2 -type d -name 'tmp*' | wc -l              # 28117
    du -sh "$TMPDIR"                                                     # 7.0G

The plant-guard fixture is byte-identical in four repositories of this family
(md5 `623a086d10a04940573c31cbebb93e31`), so the 2536 trees cannot be attributed to any
one of them — which is exactly why they are reported and left in place rather than swept.
`make-skill` closed its own copy on 2026-08-19 and filed the referral (MS-02); this is
the umbrella paying it, and the module is **copied from that repository rather than
rewritten**, because two implementations of one ledger is the defect this family keeps
finding in its own history.

A `TemporaryDirectory` around each one closes the leak. It does not close the defect,
because the defect is that a completed run said nothing about what it left, so the next
leak is invisible in exactly the same way. So every temp tree in this suite is taken
through `workspace()`, and every run ends with one line naming its residue — `nothing`
included. That line is the check: the next leak shows up in the gate's own output rather
than in somebody's `du`.

**A failing case keeps its tree, deliberately.** A plant is debugged by reading the copy
it landed in, and a cleanup that runs only on the pass path deletes the evidence exactly
when it is wanted. So a case that fails — or raises anything at all, including an error
that is not an assertion — keeps its workspace; the report names the path, names the case
that owns it, and prints the `rm -rf` that ends it. A clean case's tree goes at exit.

The prefix is part of the mechanism: `sshlg-skills-test-…` makes any future residue
attributable to this suite by name. The 2536 directories measured above are plain
`tmpXXXXXXXX` and are indistinguishable from every other program's — which is why they
have to be reported and left alone rather than swept.

    import residue
    residue.open_case(name)
    d = residue.workspace("planted")      # removed iff the owning case passed
    residue.close_case(name)              # only on success — see above
    residue.report()                      # also wired to atexit, so it cannot be skipped

Zero dependencies, standard library only, like everything else here.
