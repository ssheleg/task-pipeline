# check-convergence.sh — release acceptance across components, for <project>.
#
# Seeded by task-pipeline (references/acceptance.md → *Release acceptance happens at
# convergence*). IT IS YOURS NOW: extend it here, section by section.
#
# WHY IT EXISTS. Stage 10 already required `git submodule status` with no `+` and every
#   repository clean and pushed. That is a statement about COMMITS: the parent points at
#   the child's newest one. It does not prove anything works at those two versions
#   together. A parent can point at a green submodule whose contract the parent calls
#   with the previous signature, and every check passes — the submodule's suite ran
#   against the submodule, the parent's against the parent, and no check ran across the
#   pointer. Neither repository looks wrong alone.
#
# SCOPE: it checks the POINTERS mechanically and the SEAM by record. It does NOT run your
#   cross-component test — it cannot know what that is — it requires that one was run and
#   that its record names the exact versions it observed. Read this before quoting a green
#   from here as evidence of a working composition.
#
# EXIT CODE IS THE OUTPUT: non-zero on any failure. Nothing runs after the VERDICT block.
#
# PORTABLE to macOS bash 3.2: no grep -P, no readarray, no mapfile, no sed -i.
#
# PROGRESSIVE ARMING: a section whose input does not exist prints `dormant:` and does NOT
#   fail. A project with no components, or a range in which no component pointer moved,
#   has no seam to prove — and a gate that starts red teaches its project on day one that
#   the gate is noise.
#
# USAGE: check-convergence.sh [<base-ref>]      # default: origin/HEAD, else the root commit
